## Triangulo Java
---
The first part of the code defines a class named Main, which calculates the missing side of a right triangle using the Pythagoras theorem. It initializes variables catetoB and catetoC with given values, calculates the hypotenuse hypotenuseA, and prints the result.


The second part of the code also defines a class named Main, but this time it calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. It initializes variables base and height with given values, calculates the area, and prints the result.

The first exercise: Combinee lines 18-31 into one single println() statement, using '+' to concatenate all the items together.


The second exercise: In Mathematics, we could omit the multiplication sign in an arithmetic expression, e.g., x = 5a + 4b. In programming, you need to explicitly provide all the operators, i.e., x = 5*a + 4*b. Try printing the sum of 31 times of number1 and 17 times of number2.


The thisrd exercise: Based on the above example, write a program called SumProduct3Numbers, which introduces one more int variable called number3, and assign it an integer value of 77. Compute and print the sum and product of all the three numbers.
