## Triangulo Java
---
The first part of the code defines a class named Main, which calculates the missing side of a right triangle using the Pythagoras theorem. It initializes variables catetoB and catetoC with given values, calculates the hypotenuse hypotenuseA, and prints the result.


The second part of the code also defines a class named Main, but this time it calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. It initializes variables base and height with given values, calculates the area, and prints the result.

## 5/12/2024 exercices
---
The first exercise combinees lines 18-31 into one single println() statement, using '+' to concatenate all the items together.


The second exercise is a program that calculates the sum of two numbers, where the first number is multiplied by 31 and the second number is multiplied by 17, then it prints the result.


The third exercise is a program that calculates the sum of three numbers, where the first number is multiplied by 31, the second number is multiplied by 17, and then the third number is added. Finally, it prints the result.

## While
---
**First**: Calculates the sum of all integers from 9 to 899 (inclusive) and prints the result.


**Second**: This program calculates the sum of all odd integers from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) and prints the result.


**Third**: This program calculates the sum of all numbers divisible by 7 from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) and prints the result.


**Fourth**: This program calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and prints the result.


**Fifth**: This program calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and prints the result.

## While 2
---
The first program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7, but not by 15, 21, 35, or 105, and prints the result.


The second program counts the number of leap years between 999 and 2010 (inclusive) and prints each leap year with "AD" appended to it, then it prints the total number of leap years found.

## Instances of Circles
---
On the first one we have to create an instance of a circle with default parameter.


On the second one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius 5.


On the third one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius 10 and the color green.


On the fourth one we have to create an instance of a circle with radius -2 and the color greenish.


On the fifth one we have to create an instance of a circle with default radius but colo blue.

## Create a Book class
---
The Book class provides a blueprint for creating book objects. It encapsulates the data related to a book and provides methods to access and modify that data. The class uses data encapsulation by declaring instance variables as private and using public getters and setters to get or change the information of the book. It also includes constructors to generate the object either with default values or with especific atributes like the title, author...
