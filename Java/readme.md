## Triangulo Java
---
The first part of the code defines a class named Main, which calculates the missing side of a right triangle using the Pythagoras theorem. It initializes variables catetoB and catetoC with given values, calculates the hypotenuse hypotenuseA, and prints the result.


The second part of the code also defines a class named Main, but this time it calculates the area of a triangle given the base and height. It initializes variables base and height with given values, calculates the area, and prints the result.

The first exercise: Combinee lines 18-31 into one single println() statement, using '+' to concatenate all the items together.


The second exercise: In Mathematics, we could omit the multiplication sign in an arithmetic expression, e.g., x = 5a + 4b. In programming, you need to explicitly provide all the operators, i.e., x = 5*a + 4*b. Try printing the sum of 31 times of number1 and 17 times of number2.


The third exercise: Based on the above example, write a program called SumProduct3Numbers, which introduces one more int variable called number3, and assign it an integer value of 77. Compute and print the sum and product of all the three numbers.

## While
---
First: Calculates the sum of all integers from 9 to 899 (inclusive) and prints the result.


Second: This program calculates the sum of all odd integers from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) and prints the result.


Third: This program calculates the sum of all numbers divisible by 7 from 1 to 1000 (inclusive) and prints the result.


Fourth: This program calculates the sum of the squares of all numbers from 1 to 100 (inclusive) and prints the result.


Fifth: This program calculates the product of all numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and prints the result.

## While 2
---
The first program calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to 1000 that are divisible by 3, 5, or 7, but not by 15, 21, 35, or 105, and prints the result.


The second program counts the number of leap years between 999 and 2010 (inclusive) and prints each leap year with "AD" appended to it, then it prints the total number of leap years found.
