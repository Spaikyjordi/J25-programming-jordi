- **Algorithm**: An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.
- **Arrays**: Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the animals in cages are the variables inside.
- **Bit**: The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits.
- **Camel case**: Variables should be named using camel case, meaning the first word of the name is lowercase and each new word after that is capitalized.
- **Coding languages**: Computers use coding languages to understand what people want them to do. Just like how people communicate with each other in English or Japanese, people communicate with computers in languages like C++ or Java.
- **Else statements**: Else statements are used to do something else when the condition in the if statement isn't true.

- **Library**: A library is a collection of code made by other programmers for you to import and use.
- **Strings**: Variables can hold data besides numbers, including words. Programmers refer to variables holding words as strings.
- **Compiling**: Take and translate the whole source code into machine code.
- **Interperer**: Have the source code and transform line by line to machine code.
- **Boilerplate**: In computer programming, boilerplate code, or simply boilerplate, are sections of code that are repeated in multiple places with little to no variation.
