### Types of computers
Different types:
- Server
- Laptop (portable)
- Desktop Tower
- Mobile
- Smartwatch
- Calculator
- Gaming Consoles
- TV
- Household Appliances
- Router


A refrigerator is controlled by a microcontroller, which is a board or circuit with relatively low processing capacity. For example:
- Arduino
- Embedded within a thermostat
- Washing machines
- Calculators
**More complex computers:**
- Multi-layered hardware (Boards) -> Raspberry Pi (It's a simpler computer, can serve as a server)
- Multiple layers of Software
**Computer resources:**
- Processing capabilities
- Memory (Primary, Secondary)
- Bandwidth - communication speed
**Processing capability:**
- CPU -> Central Processing Unit
- GPU -> Graphic Processing Unit
