## üìö‚Äãüåã‚ÄãNotes on Towerüìö‚Äãüåã‚Äã
- **Power supply**
  - Max power 500
    - Coil
    - Diode
    - Capacitor
    - Heat sink
    - Microcontroller

- **Motherboard**
  - CPU: (Intel Core i3 3240)
    - Hidden in the heat sink
      - Thermal paste
      - Fan
      - Metal piece

- **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)**:
  - Has its small heat sink
  - It's an interface

- **Firmware**:
  - It's software embedded in hardware with the purpose of controlling that particular hardware.

- **Two types of memories**:
  - Primary:
    - Directly accessible (By the CPU)
      - RAM (Random Access Memory)
      - ROM (Read Only Memory)

  - Secondary:
    - Not directly accessible
    - HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
    - SSD (Solid State Drive)

- **Battery**:
  - It's a small battery that sends power to a component of the motherboard which keeps the time on the motherboard.

- **Transistor**:
  - Type of semiconductor electronic device, capable of modifying an output electrical signal in response to an input one, serving as an amplifier, switch, oscillator, or rectifier of the same.
  - It works if you give it electricity, otherwise not.

- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**:
  - This approach says that the instruction should be few and very optimized.
  - This has the advantage of allowing easy multi-coring and setting several CPUs in parallel. Nowadays you can see it in microcontrollers.

- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**:
  - This category exists as a non-established antonym of RISC, meaning "everything that is not RISC". But the main concept is that the CPU should have as many instructions as possible so you can use it directly.

- **CACHE**:
  - Hardware: elements that are between the CPU and RAM, to store the elements we use most frequently.

- **The Control Unit (CU**:
  - Responsible for managing the CPU.
  - Controls the retrieval of instructions and data from primary memory to the CPU. What is going to be fed to the ALU (the beast).
  - Contains several registers, which are small storage locations that can hold data, usually in multiples of 8 bits. Two of them are:
    - MAR
    - MDR

## Memory Architectures:
### 2 main architectures:
The first one is **Von Neumann**: This architecture uses one type of memory for instructions and data. Most microprocessors of laptops use this kind of architecture.

The second is **Harvard**:
- It distinguishes between the memory for instructions and the memory for data.

## Components
### Power Supply
A power supply works by converting the power from a wall outlet and channeling it to each individual component in the system through various cables.


There are different types of power supplies for PCs, classified by their size or form factor, such as:
- **ATX (Advanced Technology eXtended)**
- **SFX (Small Form Factor)**
- **SFX-L (SFX Large)**
- **TFX (Thin Form Factor)**
- **Flex ATX**


In my case, I use an ATX power supply, which is characterized by being the most common format among power supplies. It has dimensions of approximately 150 mm wide, 86 mm high, and 140 mm deep. It offers many power and connector options, which are suitable for most standard-sized PC configurations.

### Motherboard
The motherboard is one of the most important components when assembling a computer. The RAM, CPU, hard drives, and power supply, essential elements for a computer to function at full capacity, are connected to this piece. Inside the motherboard, there are several microprocessors that perform different functions, such as audio processing, and USB input ports...

### Processor (CPU)
The CPU, or central processing unit, is the main component that processes information. It acts as the computer's brain, transmitting information to all other components of the system. The CPU is the hardware part responsible for interacting with the software (there are more, but it is the main one).

### RAM
Random Access Memory (RAM) is short-term storage memory. The operating system of computers or other devices uses RAM to temporarily store all programs and their execution processes.


That is, when you load a game, all the information of that game goes to the RAM because it is much faster than accessing the SSD memory. The more RAM you have, the higher fps (frames per second) games will have.


When you turn off the computer, the data stored in the RAM is erased, unlike hard drives which continue to store information after power loss.

### HDD and SSD
**HDD**


In a computer's hard disk drive (HDD), the data of the computer is stored. In this last decade, solid-state drives (SSD) have appeared. HDDs compared to SSDs are slower, but some people prefer HDDs because they seem to be more secure.


In addition to being faster than hard drives, SSD cards are substantially much smaller. This leaves space for other components or for making smaller PC builds.


**SSD**


An SSD is a storage device that, unlike hard disk drives, uses non-volatile memory (Flash) to store and access data. In other words: it has no mechanical parts.


Since SSDs have no mechanical parts, they are less prone to failure due to shocks, vibrations, or mechanical wear compared to HDDs. This makes them better suited for use in portable devices and places where durability is important. That's why desktop computers usually have hard disk drives (HDD), while laptops have solid-state drives (SSD).


SSDs are also much quieter than HDDs because they have no mechanical parts. Besides being quieter, they have much higher electrical efficiency than HDDs.

### Graphics Card (GPU)
A graphics card, also known as a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), is the component of the computer responsible for processing and rendering images, videos, and graphics on the screen. Basically, it calculates triangles very quickly.
In comparison with the CPU, the GPU performs much simpler calculations, but much faster. That's why GPUs are used for cryptocurrency mining.


There are two types of GPUs. The first type is integrated directly into the processor, while the second is independent:
- Dedicated: These GPUs share resources with the CPU and system memory, meaning they use the same RAM as the processor and other system components. Therefore, they will be slower. They are more common in laptops and mobile devices.
- Integrated: They have their own dedicated VRAM memory and specialized graphics processors. They are designed to provide superior graphics performance compared to integrated GPUs.

### PCI Card
A network card is a device installed inside a computer to enable it to connect to the Internet. Depending on the type of card, it may include a port on its back for connecting an Ethernet cable or for wireless connection.


There are several types of network cards:
- **Ethernet:** These cards include a port with the 8P8C standard and the RJ45 connector.
- **Token Ring:** These fell out of use as they were considerably more expensive than others.
- **Arcnet:** Its acronym stands for "attached resource computer network." They were created in the 1980s but fell out of use because they had a much lower connection speed than Ethernet.
- **PCMIA:** Installed on the motherboard of laptops. It does not include an antenna.


**Types of Ports:**
- An RJ45 port. It is the most popular standard and offers maximum stability to your connection.
- BNC. It connects and disconnects easily. It is used for coaxial cable.
