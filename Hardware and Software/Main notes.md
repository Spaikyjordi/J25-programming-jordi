### Types of computers
Different types:
- Server
- Laptop (portable)
- Desktop Tower
- Mobile
- Smartwatch
- Calculator
- Gaming Consoles
- TV
- Household Appliances
- Router


A refrigerator is controlled by a microcontroller, which is a board or circuit with relatively low processing capacity. For example:
- Arduino
- Embedded within a thermostat
- Washing machines
- Calculators

**More complex computers:**
- Multi-layered hardware (Boards) -> Raspberry Pi (It's a simpler computer, can serve as a server)
- Multiple layers of Software


**Computer resources:**
- Processing capabilities
- Memory (Primary, Secondary)
- Bandwidth - communication speed


**Processing capability:**
- CPU -> Central Processing Unit
- GPU -> Graphic Processing Unit

## Notes on Tower
- **Power supply**
  - Max power 500
    - Coil
    - Diode
    - Capacitor
    - Heat sink
    - Microcontroller

- **Motherboard**
  - CPU: (Intel Core i3 3240)
    - Hidden in the heat sink
      - Thermal paste
      - Fan
      - Metal piece

- **BIOS (Basic Input Output System)**:
  - Has its small heat sink
  - It's an interface

- **Firmware**:
  - It's software embedded in hardware with the purpose of controlling that particular hardware.

- **Two types of memories**:
  - Primary:
    - Directly accessible (By the CPU)
      - RAM (Random Access Memory)
      - ROM (Read Only Memory)

  - Secondary:
    - Not directly accessible
    - HDD (Hard Disk Drive)
    - SSD (Solid State Drive)

- **Battery**:
  - It's a small battery that sends power to a component of the motherboard which keeps the time on the motherboard.

- **Transistor**:
  - Type of semiconductor electronic device, capable of modifying an output electrical signal in response to an input one, serving as an amplifier, switch, oscillator, or rectifier of the same.
  - It works if you give it electricity, otherwise not.

- **RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computing)**:
  - This approach says that the instruction should be few and very optimized.
  - This has the advantage of allowing easy multi-coring and setting several CPUs in parallel. Nowadays you can see it in microcontrollers.

- **CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computing)**:
  - This category exists as a non-established antonym of RISC, meaning "everything that is not RISC". But the main concept is that the CPU should have as many instructions as possible so you can use it directly.

- **CACHE**:
  - Hardware: elements that are between the CPU and RAM, to store the elements we use most frequently.

- **The Control Unit (CU**:
  - Responsible for managing the CPU.
  - Controls the retrieval of instructions and data from primary memory to the CPU. What is going to be fed to the ALU (the beast).
  - Contains several registers, which are small storage locations that can hold data, usually in multiples of 8 bits. Two of them are:
    - MAR
    - MDR

## Memory Architectures:
### 2 main architectures:
The first one is **Von Neumann**: This architecture uses one type of memory for instructions and data. Most microprocessors of laptops use this kind of architecture.

The second is **Harvard**:
- It distinguishes between the memory for instructions and the memory for data.
