# MarkUp Languages
## What are MarkUp languages??
Markup languages are a type of computer language that uses tags or codes to annotate or "mark up" elements within a digital document to define its structure, formatting, or presentation. 


The markup itself typically consists of a set of predefined tags or codes that are embedded within the text of the document. These tags describe the structure of the document (such as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.) and specify how various elements should be displayed (such as font size, color, alignment, etc.).
## Common MarkUp languages
### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of a web page by using tags.


Example of HTML:

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
XML is a versatile markup language used for storing and transporting data. It allows users to define their own custom tags.
## 🕸️🕸️HTML web made by us🕸️🕸️
This is a rudimentary version of what an HTML web looks like, obviusly this is a very primitive one since we where only experimenting with the different tags that HTML files have.

The code behind this rudimentary web is this one (for you to see an example):

## Identation
Identation is adding space or tabs at the beginning of a line of text to visually distinguish it from the other lines. It also makes it easier to understand.


Example of idented:
- Blabla bla
  - So bla bla bla
  - Blublu blu


Example without identation:


Capitulo blabla bla


Blabla personajes


Pedro


Paula
