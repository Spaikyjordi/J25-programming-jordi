# Binary Code
## What is binary code?
Binary code is a system of representing text, computer processor instructions, or any other data using a binary system, which relies on two symbols, typically represented as 0 and 1. Binary code is the language all computers in the world use.


In binary code, each digit is referred to as a bit and a sequence of eight bits is called a byte. Each bit in a binary number can have 2 posible values of information. 
- 1 bit = b
- 8 bits = 1 byte = B (2^8 posibles valores)


So:
- 1 bit = 2 valores posibles
- 2 bits = 4 valores posibles
- 3 bits = 8 valores posibles
- 4 bits = 16 valores
- 8 bits = 256 valores

## Multiples of binary code
- 1 **KByte** = 1 kB = 1024 bytes (2^10 Bytes)
- 1 **MByte** = 1 MB = 1024 kB = 2^10 kB = 2^20 B
- 1 **GByte** = 1024 MB = 2^10 MB = 2^30 bytes = 2^33bits
- 1 **TByte** = 1024 GB = 2^40B = 2^43 bits
