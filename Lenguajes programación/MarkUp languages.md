# MarkUp Languages
## What are MarkUp languages??
Markup languages are a type of computer language that uses tags or codes to annotate or "mark up" elements within a digital document to define its structure, formatting, or presentation. 


The markup itself typically consists of a set of predefined tags or codes that are embedded within the text of the document. These tags describe the structure of the document (such as headings, paragraphs, lists, etc.) and specify how various elements should be displayed (such as font size, color, alignment, etc.).
## Common MarkUp languages
### HTML (HyperText Markup Language)
HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and web applications. It defines the structure of a web page by using tags.


Example of HTML:

### XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
XML is a versatile markup language used for storing and transporting data. It allows users to define their own custom tags.
## 🕸️🕸️HTML web made by us🕸️🕸️
This is a rudimentary version of what an HTML web looks like, obviusly this is a very primitive one since we where only experimenting with the different tags that HTML files have.

The code behind this rudimentary web is this one (for you to see an example):

## Identation
Identation is adding space or tabs at the beginning of a line of text to visually distinguish it from the other lines. It also makes it easier to understand.


**Example of idented**:
- Blabla bla
  - So bla bla bla
  - Blublu blu


**Example without identation**:


Capitulo blabla bla


Blabla personajes

## Static and dynamic web pages
### Static

Static web pages are what you see is what you get. They're made using HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript, and they pretty much stay the same unless someone edits the code behind it.


**Characteristics**:
- Fast loading speeds: Since they're pre-made, static pages load up super fast because they don't need any processing since they are stored in the server.
- Simple to Keep Up: They're easy to create and to manage because they're usually just simple HTML files.
- Not Super Interactive: Static pages can't really change or update content based on what users do, they can change if you change the code.


**Examples:**
- [Space Jam Web](https://www.spacejam.com/1996/jam.htm)
- [David Prieto Web](https://fabacademy.org/2020/labs/barcelona/students/david-prieto/)

### Dynamic 


Dynamic web pages are made by the server in real-time, depending on what users do. They usually run on server-side technologies like PHP, Python, Ruby, or Node.js, which let them change things in real-time and interact with users.


**Characteristics**:
- Personalized Content: They can dish out personalized content based on what users like or where they're at (cookies).
- Database: Dynamic pages can talk to databases to grab or store info, which is handy for things like user logins, managing content, and online shopping.
- Interactive and Fun: These pages can respond to what users do right away, so they're great for things like online forms, searching stuff, and getting real-time updates.

## Networks
### Architecture:
- Client-server
  - Client-side:
    - Requests (request) → URL
  - Server-side:
    - Responds to the client


URL = Uniform Resource Locator. "URL" is different from a Link:
- The link takes you to the URL


After a question mark (?) in a URL, variables come, usually found in YouTube URLs:
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2os_1fMGZQ


What each part does:
- https:// → Protocol
- www → Subdomain
- youtube.com → Domain
- /watch → Path
- ?V= Oz230zoewnfaz: After the ?, variables come
### Different networks
- **Internet**
  - Physical network of interconnected computers (Hardware)
- **World Wide Web**
  - Resources (software, data) stored on the internet

### Wi-Fi
Computer → AP (Access Point) → Router → ISP (Internet Service Provider) → DNS Server → Server (Google or whatever you searched for)


Computer, AP, Router: Local networks (Wi-Fi/Physical)
ISP, DNS, Server: Non-physical components

### Wi-Fi Arquitecture
Not only on the internet but also applicable to other connections.

### Example with Brawl Stars

The arquitecture that brawl stars use is the next one:
- P2P (Peer-to-Peer)
  - Git torrent
- Peer-to-peer
  - Decentralized
  - Port-to-port
    - Among equals
- System for sharing data
  - Client and server at the same time

### Network Hardware
- Access Point → Only Wi-Fi
- Switch → Connect via Cable, different computers
- Router → Routing
  - Gateway between networks
- Wi-Fi:
  - Signal through the air
