This Arduino code defines functions for spelling out the Morse code representation of the word "JORDI" using the built-in LED on pin 13. 
The morseBlink function is used to control the blinking of the LED based on the number of dots specified for each letter.
The dotDuration variable controls the duration of a single dot.
