This Arduino code represents a simple cooking system that keeps track of ingredients (eggs, potato, onion, and oil). 
And can create a Spanish Omelette if the specified conditions are met.
The global variables eggs, potato, oil, and onion represent the quantities of each ingredient. The initial values are set in the code.
The loop function continuously reads input from the Serial Monitor using Serial.readString(). 
The decide function checks the input string. If it's "cook," it calls the cook function. If it's "potato," it increments the potato count.
The cook function checks if there are enough ingredients to make a Spanish Omelette. 
If so, it prints a message indicating that a Spanish Omelette can be made and updates the quantities of ingredients accordingly.
