This simple Arduino code prints the message "Hello World" to the Serial Monitor and then waits for 1 second before repeating the process.
In the setup function, Serial.begin(9600); initializes the serial communication at a baud rate of 9600. This allows communication between the Arduino and a connected computer through the USB port.
