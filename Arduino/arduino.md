# Blink Task 1
In the **setup function**:


It sets pin 13 (which is usually connected to the built-in LED on many Arduino boards) as an output.
It turns the LED on for 1.5 seconds, then off for 1 second.
It turns the LED on for 0.5 seconds, then off for 1 second.


In the **loop function**:
It creates a repeating pattern where the LED is turned on for 0.125 seconds and then off for 0.125 seconds, creating a blinking effect. This pattern repeats indefinitely.


In summary, the code initializes the LED pin, performs a specific sequence of turning the LED on and off in the setup function, and then enters an infinite loop in the loop function that blinks the LED with a specific timing pattern.
