This modified code breaks down the Morse code for each letter into separate functions (example: morse_J(), morse_O(), etc.) to improve code organization and readability.
Each function represents the Morse code for a specific letter by turning the LED on and off.
The loop function then calls each Morse code function for the letters 'J', 'O', 'R', 'D', and 'I' in sequence, followed by a 3-second delay between each letter. This loop continues indefinitely.
