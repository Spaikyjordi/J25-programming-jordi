This Arduino code expands on the previous code and now flashes the built-in LED on pin 13 to represent the Morse code for the word "JORDI." The Morse code for each letter is represented by a sequence of dots (short flashes) and dashes (long flashes),
with pauses in between.
After spelling "JORDI," the durations of dots, dashes, and pauses are halved to speed up the Morse code transmission, and the loop continues.
