This Arduino code implements a simple cooking system that reads input from the Serial Monitor and performs an action based on the input.
The loop function continuously reads input from the Serial Monitor using Serial.readString().
The decide function checks the input string and, if it equals "cook", calls the cook function.
The cook function prints a message indicating that it is cooking.
How ut works:
You send "cook" through the Serial Monitor.
The Arduino reads "cook," calls decide, and since the input matches "cook," it calls the cook function.
The cook function prints "We are cooking Jessie" to the Serial Monitor.
