# Final project

## Goal of the project
It's a project that reads the Serial and outputs different results depending on the Strings that you send to the serial.


The mandatory features are:
- Echo when you write something through serial (is going to reply the same command just to be sure that the command has been sent properly.) 
- Write a line in morse code if you write "m: " or "morse " for the command and the line after will be sent as morse code. 
- If the command is correct send a cooking recipee of the dish of your choice. 
- Play (or stop) a song


The point of all of this is the integration of the different parts.
